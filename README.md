Community maintained Tabletop Simulator bug tracker.

## Filing a bug

Before filing a bug, please [search for an existing issue](https://github.com/tts-community/tts-community-bug-tracker/issues) first.

If you do find an existing issue, please refrain from commenting unless you're providing new information (i.e. confirmation the bug still existing in a new TTS release). Instead if you just want to indicate you have the same issue, please thumbs up the first post in the issue thread.

Once you've established your problem is not already documented, you may [file a new bug report here](https://github.com/tts-community/tts-community-bug-tracker/issues/new/choose).

## Will these bugs be fixed?

This is a community maintained list of bugs. Its primary purpose is to help the mod development community become aware of unexpected behavior.

By properly documenting the bugs it should make it easier to forward this same information onto Berserk Games, who may be able to fix the issues. However, to be perfectly clear, we have no official affiliation with Berserk Games.

## Who maintains this bug tracker?

The Tabletop Simulator community at large are encouraged to contribute. Officially, this project is maintained by a semi-formal community group that also maintain [https://tts-community.github.io/](https://tts-community.github.io/) and are reachable on the [TTS Community Discord](https://discord.gg/xrqynr2).
